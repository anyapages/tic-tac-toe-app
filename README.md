# tic-tac-toe-app
A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built with React

Your task in this activity is to do the following:
Part 1

    Display the next player to play (Player X or Player O). This should show which player's turn it is. It should be updated every time a player selects a square
    Update the color of the mark based on the player's turn. "X" should be red, and "O" should be white.

At the end, the game board should look like the following

Now, in Part 2, you'll change the color of the mark based on the player's turn. "X" should be red, and "O" should be white.
Part 2

The styles.css file includes the css classes you'll need to accomplish this task:

    .red: Apply this class to the "X" player
    .white: Apply this class to the "O" player

_Hint: You'll want use conditional logic via a ternary operator to set the className value. Learn more about the ternary operator here._
