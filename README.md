# Tic-Tac-Toe App

A 2-player pastel Tic-Tac-Toe game, built with React. üç≠

## Tasks:

- Display the next player to play (Player X or Player O). This should show which player's turn it is.  It should be updated every time a player selects a square
- Update the color of the mark based on the player's turn. "X" should be red, and "O" should be green.

At the end, the game should look like the following:

<img src = 'xo.png' width="500" height="440"> 

The text showing the player in turn (Player X's turn) should be displayed below the board and should be contained within an `<h1></h1>`  tag and have the id turn.

## Solution
I use conditional logic via a ternary operator to set the `className` value.  Learn more about the [ternary operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator/) 

```javaScript
className={tik == "1" ? "red" : "green"}
      onClick={() => {
        setTik(takeTurn(id));
        setFilled(true);
        console.log(`Square: ${id} filled by player : ${tik}`);
      }}
    >
      <h1>{mark[tik]}</h1>
```

## Usage
<img src = 'Example.gif' width="580" height="360">
